About us
We are called FinKraft.

What do we do?
FinKraft crafts reliable automated solutions to simplify complex business processes.

How do we do it?
The process of gathering information, collecting data from various sources, and reconciling records is typically painstaking and complex. With FinKraft, companies need not worry about any of it. We have built a robust automated SaaS platform to assist our clients with these processes and eliminate human error.

One of the first use cases we mastered is GST credit on travel expenses for corporate India. "Capgemini" saves one million dollars annually using our tool. This marked the beginning of our continuous innovation. We aim to make a difference across industries. A few of our other clients include:

Consulting: McKinsey, Boston Consulting
Pharma: Abbott, Sun Pharma
Retail: Ikea, Godrej, Benetton
Government: WHO, World Bank, US Embassy
Banking: American Express, Kotak
Industrial: Emerson, Schneider
Others: WPP Group, Hershey’s, Tata’s
Our Robotic Process Automation (RPA) system simplifies the extraction of information from emails, websites, and other portals. Post-extraction, our system helps read and extract data, reconcile, and create actionable real-time dashboards. Strong archiving with an excellent document management system ensures quick and easy retrieval. Our portal highlights inconsistencies and errors in the data, enabling clients to take appropriate measures promptly. This saves time, money, and enables companies to obtain error-free reports with just a click!
